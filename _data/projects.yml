  description: >
    Led a 10-member engineering team in the SHPE UCF Payload Challenge to design and test a 3U CubeSat payload 
    for data collection during rocket ascent to 10,000 ft. Oversaw rigorous validation of sensors and microcontrollers, 
    applied iterative design refinements, and optimized system reliability—achieving a 20% increase in efficiency. 
    Strengthened skills in embedded systems, data acquisition, and cross-functional teamwork.

- project: Obstacle-Dodging Game on FPGA
  role: Developer
  duration: 2023
  description: >
    Designed and implemented a plane-dodging game using Verilog and Intel Quartus. 
    Developed state-machine-based gameplay mechanics, integrated LEDs and button inputs, 
    and optimized the system for smooth performance on the SharkBoard KCT01 FPGA.

- project: Automated Pet Feeder
  role: Designer & Programmer
  duration: 2022
  description: >
    Built a fully automated pet feeder using Arduino Uno, servo motors, and custom PCB design in Eagle. 
    Programmed control logic in C for precise food portioning and display integration, creating a compact and reliable prototype.

- project: Ultrasonic Sensor PCB System
  role: PCB Designer
  duration: 2024
  description: >
    Designed and fabricated multiple PCBs featuring voltage regulators for 3.3V and 5V output. 
    Integrated ultrasonic sensors and LED displays to measure object distance in real time, improving system accuracy and stability.

- project: TCP Protocol Data Transfer System
  role: Developer
  duration: 2022
  description: >
    Developed a data transfer system using Python, TCP sockets, and FTP protocols for efficient client-server communication. 
    Automated error handling and optimized network performance through Wireshark analysis.
